Reviews for Known
=================

Adds support for publishing reviews to the [Known CMS](http://withknown.com).
Content will also support the [h-review
microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-review) and [h-product
microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-product). To install, simply clone
this repository to your `IdnoPlugins` subdirectory of your Known installation,
using the directory name `Review`, and enable the plugin.

Future Iteration
----------------

Currently, this plugin simply allows for publishing of review content. Over
time, I'd like to see it evolve to support additional functionality:

  * Syndication of specific types of review content to appropriate silos:
    - Amazon (most products)
    - Goodreads (books)
    - Rotten Tomatoes / IMDB (movies and tv shows)
    - etc.
  
  * Embedding of affiliate links on reviews as a way for publishers to make
    money from their sites.

Please feel free to contribute!
